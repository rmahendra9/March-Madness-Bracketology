# NCAA-Basketball-Games-Predictor

This repo contains models aimed at predicting the outcomes of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament.

## Acknowledgements

I want to acknowledge Bart Torvik (https://barttorvik.com/#) as the data for NCAA Basketball teams was pulled from there.

## The Motivation

The idea for this project is inspired by this paper on using a kNN methodology to predict the winners of the NCAA March Madness Tournament (https://engineering.purdue.edu/KongLab/publications/NCAABracketSelection_Kong.pdf). In this paper, the author used Pythagorean Expectation to find similarity scores between teams and used this data to predict games in March Madness.
