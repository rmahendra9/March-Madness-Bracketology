# NCAA-Basketball-Games-Predictor

This repo contains models aimed at predicting the outcomes of NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. It is a bit disorganized now, but a naive model of AdjO and AdjD differences were used and a machine learning model using XGBoost was used.

## Results

The best model and its performance on the ESPN Bracket Challenge can be seen in this repository in the PDF file.

## Acknowledgements

I want to acknowledge KenPom, Pi-Rate Rankings and Bart Torvik as the data for NCAA Basketball teams were pulled from these places.
